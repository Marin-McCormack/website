        <h3>My name is Marin McCormack. I have two older siblings: one brother, one sister, and a dog. I am committed to playing soccer at the University of Virginia after I graduate from high school in the spring of 2025. Throughout high school, I have played soccer at the highest girls' level, ECNL. I attend Arlington Tech High School located in Arlington, Virginia, and am just finishing my junior year. Since my school doesn't have sports, I played for the school I'm districted for, Yorktown. I ran high school track in my junior year, played high school lacrosse in my freshman year, and played high school golf in my freshman and sophomore years. I am passionate about computer science, specifically data science. I am a protege in the Girls in Technology program; mentors and guest speakers who are women in STEM fields come and talk to us about their experiences. In my free time, I enjoy painting rocks with kind messages to put in my local park to brighten people's days. I am the co-president of the Arlington Tech Kindness Club, and I love to volunteer with <a href="https://www.thekindnessactivist.org/">The Kindness Activist</a> and help out with projects that spread kindness around the community.</h3>

        <h2>Area of Work Interest</h2>
        <img src="data.jpeg" alt="Work Interest Image">
        <h3>My primary interest is data science. Throughout my high school career, I have taken lots of computer science classes, including AP Computer Science Principles in my freshman year, Dual Enrolled Computer Programming I, and Dual Enrolled Database Design and Management in my sophomore year. This year, I took Dual Enrollment Computer Programming II and Web Design. All of these classes have helped me gain knowledge in many different fields of computer science. In my freshman year, I learned the basics of coding in Python and how computers work. In my sophomore year, I continued my studies of Python in DE Computer Programming I; I also learned about SQL and how to manage large amounts of data in my favorite programming class I’ve taken so far: DE Database Design and Management. During my junior year, I learned the programming language C++ and also discrete math in my Computer Programming II class and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my web design class. I will be taking a statistics class my senior year which will hopefully help me grow my interest in data science.</h3>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <img src="tech.jpeg" alt="Education Image">
        <h3>I attend Arlington Tech High School in Arlington, Virginia. Arlington Tech is a Governor’s STEM Academy that offers an accelerated early-college program to APS high school students. It also offers project-based learning, which challenges students to solve real-world problems using creative solutions. 

I also take classes through NOVA. These are called Dual Enrollment classes, and they are college-level classes taught by certified teachers at my school. These classes are challenging and bring another level of academics to my school.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <img src="skills.png" alt="Skills Image">
        <h3>My skills include being a hard worker, being a leader, working well with others, and problem-solving. Most of these skills come from playing sports since I was young. While playing sports, it is necessary to be a hard worker; you must put in time outside the regular practice schedule to be your best. It is also important to be a leader on and off the field for your teammates and motivate them to perform at the highest level. Being a team player and having good team chemistry is how games are won. Without the ability to work well with others, the team wouldn't be successful. You must be able to problem-solve within seconds in sports. For example, in soccer, if the person you were originally going to pass to is now marked by an opposing player, you must find a new way to move the ball up the field. However, I did learn all these skills through soccer; they are also applied to my everyday school life!</h3>
